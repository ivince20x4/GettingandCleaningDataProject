# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The class project for Getting and Cleaning Data was to read in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:

1. Download the zip file from this URL.

2. Unzip the file to the subdirectory \UCI HAR Dataset.

3. Run the R script (run_analysis.R).

4. The output of the R script is a tidy data set, DataSetHumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphones.txt.
